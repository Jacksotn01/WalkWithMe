      <p class="Cambodia"> I set my alarm for 3am, I knew I couldn't miss the sun rising above some of the world's most beautiful temples. I waited with over 50 others to see the sun paint the sky in soft pinks, purples and blues. My journey has lead me to <span style="color: #0066cc; font-size: 40px;"> Cambodia</span> and I was standing in awe. <span style="color: #0066cc; font-size: 40px;"> Cambodia </span> with all is magic was a sad yet beautiful place. It was a place that represented strength, courage, beauty and sadly war. The people had been waged into a war, the scars were evident and the smiles that I once knew in Thailand were very rare. I left knowing that I witnessed a part of history and crossed paths with some of the most resilent people in the world.</p>
