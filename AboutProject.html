      <h1> ABOUT </h1> 

      <p> #WalkWithMe is a virtual meeting place for young travelers around the world to come together in solidarity. Traveling can often be a scary venture, especially when doing so alone but with Walk With Me you are virtually never alone. This platform will bring travelers from all over the world to share highlights, challenges, airfare discounts and travel safety tips. Walk With Me is not only a website but a movement. A movement of fun, love and care. All WWM followers will receive their first free t-shirt after signing up. This will allow for fellow travelers to identify each other as well as bring a heightened awareness to traveling and seeing the world. </p>
