      <p class="Bangkok"> Close your eyes, now imagine that you have just stepped off of a plane and onto the soil that is home to some of the most beautiful beaches, the craziest traffic and street food that fills you stomach with <span style="color: #0066cc; font-size: 40px;"> love</span> you have just stepped foot onto <span style="color: #0066cc; font-size: 40px;"> The Land of Smiles</span>. </p>

      <p class="Bangkok2"> <span style="color: #0066cc; font-size: 40px;"> Thailand </span> was my home. For 5 months I spent traveling through one of the most beautiful places my eyes have ever seen. The water was cool, the sun was hot and the people were kind. Thailand was my gateway. Through Thailand I was able to escape to Cambodia, Laos, Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia. Thailand connected me to the rest of South East Asia. I sat down with Buddahist monks, partied on beaches where the full moon was bright and full above. Thailand is and will always be a part of who I am and where I want to return to be. I met Thailand and I have been in love ever since. </p>
